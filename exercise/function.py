Background: You have a list of integers and a target number. Your task is to find the number in the list that is closest to the target number.

Challenge: Write a function that takes a list of integers numbers and a single integer target. The function should return the number from numbers that is closest to the target. 
If there are two numbers equally close, return the smaller one.

Constraints:

The list numbers will have at least one and no more than 100 integers.
Each integer in numbers will be between -1000 and 1000.
The target will be an integer between -1000 and 1000.

Example:
numbers = [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 1]
target = 9

# The function should return 8, as 8 is the closest number to 9.

numbers = [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 1]
